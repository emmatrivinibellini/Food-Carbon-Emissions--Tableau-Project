# 🌱 Food Carbon Emissions: Tableau Data Visualization

**How Your Diet Impacts Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Vegan, Vegetarian & Omnivore Comparisons**  

**Dataset:** [Global Food Emissions by Lifecycle Stage](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-emissions-production-supply-chain)  

---

## 📊 Project Overview  

This project analyzes greenhouse gas emissions associated with different types of food products.  
The goal is to support the creation of a **sustainable menu** by helping a restaurant identify ingredients with lower carbon footprints, while clearly communicating insights to a non-technical audience.  

The analysis was performed with **Tableau Public**, leveraging interactive dashboards, filters, and tooltips to make the visualizations intuitive and engaging.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- **Visualize Carbon Footprints:** Highlight total GHG emissions of different food types across all stages of production and supply chain.  
- **Diet Comparison:** Show environmental impact differences between vegan, vegetarian, and omnivorous diets.  
- **Identify Key Contributors:** Pinpoint stages of the supply chain that contribute most to emissions.  
- **Support Decision-Making:** Provide actionable insights for creating sustainable menus and promoting lower-emission diets.  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights  

- **Vegan diets** result in the lowest CO₂ emissions—approximately 4× lower than omnivorous diets.  
- **Vegetarian diets** produce 3× fewer emissions than omnivorous diets, although dairy and egg production still contribute significantly.  
- **Omnivorous diets** are the most carbon-intensive due to resource-heavy animal agriculture.  
- The analysis clearly demonstrates that **shifting towards plant-based foods is an effective strategy to reduce environmental impact**.
